A Handbook of Liberation
An Anarchist Manifesto by A. Bakalov
Preamble

No one but you knows how to live your life better than you do.
No one but you wears your skin, your dream, your shadow.
No one but you has the right to say who you are.

If someone watches over you, teaches you, judges you, protects you, leads you — and you didn’t ask for it — that’s not help, that’s unsolicited guardianship.
It’s slavery wrapped in a thin veil of fear of “anarchy.”
Free people don’t need a system of guardianship.

This handbook does not come to teach you, but to remind you —
Of what you’ve known all along.
Of freedom that is not a choice, but a starting point.

It is not written to command you. It is written to liberate the thought already within you.
I. Liberation of Thought

If states could, they would put stamps on thoughts.
But they can’t. Not yet.

That’s why everything begins there — where no one can enter but you.
In the room of your consciousness, there is no surveillance.
Only you, and you in the mirror.

Nothing and no one can enslave the thought of a free person.

So know this — no one can enslave your thought, and from it, everything else is born.

Imagine it like this:

    You use your own calendar and sign documents with dates according to your own timekeeping.

    You publish a public statement that your view on the law is not a threat — but sovereignty of thought which the state must not and cannot sanction.

    You write and sign your own “personal constitution,” with no need for anyone’s recognition.

    You refuse to use imposed forms that assign you the status of a slave without consent — you create your own.

    You insist that every “social contract” was forced upon you without your consent and upheld through coercion.

II. Liberation of Agreement

You don’t need permission to agree with someone.
You don’t need a notary to confirm your truth.

If you and someone else wish to create something together — that is already a law unto itself.

Anything that doesn’t require force to survive — has the right to exist.
Anything that requires force to exist — will eventually disappear.
If you and others agree that something is — then it is.

No state may place its stamp on your agreement unless you permit it.

Justice is not a courthouse.
A word given in trust is worth more than a seal.

This is how it was before kings, before records, before imposed laws.
And this is how it can be again — without hatred, without destruction, without fear.
Only with people who know what they say, and stand behind their words.

Imagine it like this:

    You enter employment with a cryptographic signature — no notary, no registration.

    You marry before your community and record it in the public ledger of the free.

    You write a will, sign it, and keep it — no state seal, but with witnesses and your will.

    You start a marketplace based on agreement, reputation, and freedom — not permits.

III. Liberation of Action

You don’t ask for permission to breathe, to think, to love — so why ask it to create?

When you bake bread, value has already been created.
When you share knowledge, wealth has already spread.
When two people exchange something, the agreement is already valid.

There is no abstract force that knows the worth of your labor.
There is no office more qualified than your conscience.
There is no central authority that has created anything — that wasn’t first created by an individual!

So do not accept that your work belongs to the system.
Do not allow your effort to require registration to exist.
Do not believe you must seek the origin of your value — for you are that origin.

And if you protect yourself — that is not chaos.
If you heal yourself — that is not danger.
If you learn without their plan — that is not madness.

Only the person who stands up and says:
“I exist without the state’s permission!”
is free.

Imagine it like this:

    You do not pay taxes because you never voluntarily contracted state services — and you document this publicly.

    You work for the community in exchange for goods, knowledge, or tokens — without intermediaries.

    You use your own currency, shared units of exchange, reputation — without banks or “economic permits.”

    You heal yourself with knowledge from your community (doctors are part of it too), and rely on those you trust — without obligation to a central system.

IV. Liberation of Communities

A free person doesn’t want to be alone — but doesn’t want to be a subject either.

Communities are not shackles. Communities are not hierarchies.
Communities are acts of free will — or else they’re not communities, but prison wings.

If five of you want to live by the same rules, let it be.
If a hundred of you want AI arbitration — let it judge. If another method is preferred, let that judge.
If someone wants silence and independence — let no one deny them.

There is no single truth that applies to all.
There is no single order everyone must follow.
There is no law that cannot be refused — if you haven’t consented to it beforehand.

Those who want order — let them build it.
Those who want guardianship — let them choose it.
But no one must be pulled by force into a world that is not theirs.

Communities must not become new states.
Communities must not have a monopoly on force.
Communities must remain porous, open, reversible.

Disputes among the free are settled not by force, but by consensus.
And when force is no longer the measure of right, there arises the need for trust.
And there, a more humane civilization is born — not from control, but from agreement.

Imagine it like this:

    Ten people sign a “pact of common living” and live by their own rules — without state permission.

    Disputes between communities are settled by an agreed-upon algorithm — artificial intelligence, a council of honor, voting, or something else.

    Every community publishes the rules it lives by, and affirms the right to leave at any time — freely.

    A group rejects contact with a community that uses force without consent — and that is the end of that relationship, not the start of war.

V. Liberation of Information

A free person cannot make decisions without access to the truth.
And truth hides where knowledge is locked away.

The state, if it is a common public matter — res publica — must not have a secret life.
If something is hidden from the people, that is not protection. It is deception.
If there is a “secret police,” the people have a master.
If there is a “state secret,” then truth has an owner.

Knowledge arises from work, experience, exchange, and error — therefore it is communal.
No institution may own knowledge created from the labor of free people.
If knowledge is funded from common resources, it must remain common.
If laws are written, they must be readable by all — not just by lawyers.

Where information flows freely, power is distributed.
Where knowledge is locked away, the state belongs to no one.

That is why the first act of a free society — is to open all closed doors.

Imagine it like this:

    Every contract made by state institutions is public, without exception — or it is void.

    There is no “confidential documentation” if it concerns lives, health, or public funds.

    All state bodies must operate under transparent protocols, and all data must become publicly available after a defined period.

    The state has no right to destroy information — and thereby its mistakes.

    Educational materials, research, and legislative processes must be freely accessible — no registration, no fees, no restrictions.

    Secret services are obsolete anti-public institutions, contradicting the very concept of common interest — and have no place in the future.

Final Word

This is not a law.
This is not a demand.
This is not a doctrine.

This is a seed of an idea.
A seed you may plant — if you want it to grow.

Liberation is not a moment. It is not a manifesto.
It is a path you walk quietly, knowing that no one’s shadow looms over your shoulder anymore.

And if they ask you:
“Who gave you the right?”
Say:
“I DID! By birth. By thought. And by standing up.”
