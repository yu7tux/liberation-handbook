A Handbook of Liberation

An Anarchist Manifesto by A. Bakalov
Preamble

No one but you knows how to live your life better than you do.
No one but you wears your skin, your dreams, your shadow.
No one but you has the right to tell you who you are.

If someone watches over you, teaches you, judges you, protects you, leads you – and you didn’t ask for it – that’s not help – that’s unsolicited guardianship.
That’s slavery wrapped in a thin veil of fear of “anarchy.”
Free people don’t need a patronage system!

This handbook doesn’t come to teach you, but to remind you,
Of what you’ve known all along.
Of freedom that isn’t a choice, but a starting point.

It isn’t written to force you. It’s written to liberate the thought that already exists within you.
I. Liberation of Thought

If states could, they would stamp even thoughts.
But they can’t. For now.

So everything begins there – where no one can enter but you!
In the room of your consciousness there is no surveillance. Only you, and you in the mirror!

No one and nothing can enslave the thought of a free person!

So know this – no one can enslave your thought, and from it everything else is born.

Imagine it like this:

    You introduce your personal calendar and sign documents with dates according to your own time reckoning.
    You publish a public statement that your opinion about the law isn’t a threat — but thought sovereignty that the state must not and cannot sanction.
    You write and sign your own “personal constitution,” without any need for anyone to recognize it.
    You refuse to use imposed forms that assign you the status of a slave without consent — you create your own.
    You insist that you were forced into every “social contract” and that you were pushed into it without consent and forced by violence to respect it.

II. Liberation of Agreements

You don’t need permission to agree with someone.
You don’t need a notary to confirm your truth.
If you and someone else wish to create something together — that’s a law that already exists by itself.

Everything that doesn’t require force to survive – has the right to exist.
Everything that requires force to exist – will eventually disappear.
If you and others agree that something is – then it is.
No state can put its stamp over your agreement, unless you allow it.

Justice is not a courthouse.
A word given in trust is worth more than a seal.

This is how it was before kings, before records, before imposed laws.
And this is how it can be again — without hatred, without destruction, without fear.
Only with people who know what they say, and who stand behind their words.

Imagine it like this:

    You enter into employment with a cryptographic signature – without a notary, without registration.
    You enter marriage before the community and record it in the public registry of the network of free people.
    You write a will, sign it and keep it — without any state seal, but with witnesses and your will.
    You start a market based on agreement, reputation and freedom — not on permits.

III. Liberation of Action

You don’t ask permission to breathe, to think, to love — so why would you ask it to create?

When you make bread, value has already been created.
When you share knowledge, wealth has already spread.
When two exchange something, the agreement is already valid.

There is no abstract force that knows how much your effort is worth.
There is no office more qualified than your conscience.
There is no central authority that has created anything — that wasn’t first created by an individual!!

So don’t accept that your work belongs to the system.
So don’t allow that your effort must be registered to exist.
So don’t believe that you must seek the origin of your value — because you are that origin!

And if you protect yourself – that’s not chaos.
If you heal yourself – that’s not danger.
If you learn without their plan – that’s not madness.
Only the person who stood up and said: “I exist without the state’s permission!” is free.

Imagine it like this:

    You don’t pay taxes because you didn’t voluntarily contract for state services – and you publicly document this.
    You work for the community in exchange for goods, knowledge or tokens – without intermediaries.
    You use your own currency, common units of exchange, reputation – without a bank and without “economic permits.”
    You heal yourself with knowledge from the community (doctors are part of the community too), you use help from those you trust – without obligation to the central system.

IV. Liberation of Communities

A free person doesn’t want to be alone — but doesn’t want to be a subject either.
Communities are not shackles. Communities are not hierarchies.
Communities are choices of free will – or they’re not communities but prison wings.

If five of you want to live by the same rules, so be it.
If a hundred of you want AI arbitration – let it judge. If you want arbitration by something else, let that other thing judge.
If someone wants silence and independence – let no one dispute that.

There is no one truth that applies to everyone.
There is no one order that everyone is obliged to follow!
There is no one law that cannot be rejected – if you haven’t previously consented to it!

Those who want order – let them build it.
Those who want guardianship – let them choose it.
But no one must be drawn by force into a world that isn’t theirs.

Communities must not become new states.
Communities must not have a monopoly on force.
Communities must remain porous, open, reversible.

Disputes among the free are resolved not by force, but by consensus.
And when force doesn’t exist as the only measure of correctness, there’s a need for trust.
And there a more humane civilization is born — not from control, but from agreement.

Imagine it like this:

    Ten people sign a “pact of common living” and live by their own rules – without state permission.
    Disputes between communities are resolved by an algorithm that everyone previously accepts – artificial intelligence, council of honor, or voting or something else.
    Each community publishes the rules by which it lives and the right to exit that system at any moment — as free.
    A group refuses contact with a community that uses force without consent – and that becomes the end of that relationship, not the beginning of war.

V. Liberation of Information

A free person cannot make decisions without access to truth.
And truth hides where knowledge is locked away.

The state, if it’s a common public matter — res publica — must not have a secret life.
If something is hidden from the people, that’s not protection. That’s deception.
If there’s a “secret police,” that means the people have a master.
If there’s a “state secret,” that means truth has an owner.

Knowledge arises in work, experience, exchange, mistakes – and therefore it’s communal.
No institution can possess knowledge created based on the work of free people.
If knowledge is financed from common funds, it must be common.
If laws are written, they must be readable to every person – not just lawyers.

Where information flows freely, power is distributed.
Where knowledge is locked away, the state no longer belongs to anyone.

That’s why the first act of a free society — is opening all closed doors.

Imagine it like this:

    Every contract of state organs is public, without exceptions — or it’s void.
    There’s no “confidential documentation” if it relates to the lives, health and money of citizens.
    All state organizations must have transparent protocols and all information after a certain time must be available to every person.
    The state has no right to destroy information and thus its mistakes.
    Educational materials, research and legislative procedures must be publicly available without registration, without payment, without restrictions.
    Secret services are anachronistic anti-state creations that negate the very essence of public interest and as such have no place in the future.

Final Word

This is not a law.
This is not a demand.
This is not a doctrine.

This is a seed of an idea.
A seed you can plant – if you want it to grow.

Liberation is not a moment! It’s not a manifesto!
It’s a path you walk peacefully, because you know there’s no one’s shadow over your shoulder anymore.

And if they ask you:
“Who gave you the right?”
say:
“I DID! By birth. By thought. And by standing up.”
